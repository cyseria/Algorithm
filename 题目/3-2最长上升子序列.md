###Description:

A numeric sequence of ai is ordered if a1 < a2 < ... < aN. 
Let the subsequence of the given numeric sequence (a1, a2, ..., aN) be any sequence (ai1, ai2, ..., aiK),
where 1 <= i1 < i2 < ... < iK <= N. 
For example, sequence (1, 7, 3, 5, 9, 4, 8) has ordered subsequences, e. g., (1, 7), (3, 4, 8) and many others. 
All longest ordered subsequences are of length 4, e. g., (1, 3, 5, 8). 

Your program, when given the numeric sequence, must find the length of its longest ordered subsequence. 



###输入格式:
There are several test cases. Every test case includes two lines. 
The first line contains the length of sequence N. The second line contains the elements of sequence - N integers
 in the range from 0 to 10000 each, 
separated by spaces. 1 <= N <= 1000 
When N is 0, it indicates test to end. 


###输出格式:
Output must contain a single integer for every test case ---- the length of the longest ordered subsequence
of the given sequence.
